# Mitch's Subtitles

Here you can find all the subtitle files, that I've made and were published on actual videos.

This repo serves as a archive and allows people to see/study how the i've made them.

To open up these files, i recommend [Subtitle Edit](https://github.com/SubtitleEdit/subtitleedit/) as I've used it during the making and got very familiar with this program (even modified it myself for additional/helpful features)

To get .ass files into youtube, check out [YTSubConverter](https://github.com/arcusmaximus/YTSubConverter). It's a good starting point, for anyone who wants to create stylised subtitles.
