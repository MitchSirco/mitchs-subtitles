1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:06,000
Thought I'd figure this all out on my own

2
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:10,620
Started hoping we just let it grow

3
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:16,020
Now the water's slowly getting cold

4
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,280
As we lose each day a little more

5
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:26,650
Caught up again, we're rusting down another high

6
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,970
Just burning up like satellites across the sky

7
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:37,340
I know I keep pretending that we're doing fine

8
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:38,970
Lost

9
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,000
Lost in

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,630
Lost in us

11
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:47,980
All I wanted

12
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:53,300
Holding up for days just to get by

13
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:58,620
All I wanted

14
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,930
Reaching out just for something to feel alive

15
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:09,330
All I wanted was you

16
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,600
And I let it slip away

17
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:19,990
All I wanted was you

18
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,680
-was you

19
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,330
And I can't make you stay

20
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,950
And I can't make you stay

21
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,270
And I can't make you stay

22
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,600
Caught up again, just chase around another life

23
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:59,930
So holding on like shadows fading in the night

24
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:05,300
I know I keep pretending but we're not alright

25
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:06,930
Not

26
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:07,960
Not en

27
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,590
Not enough

28
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:15,920
All I wanted

29
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,620
Holding up for days just to get by

30
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,570
All I wanted

31
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:31,930
Reaching out just for something to feel alive

32
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:37,330
All I wanted was you

33
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,580
And I let it slip away

34
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:47,950
All I wanted was you

35
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,680
-was you

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,250
And I can't make you stay

37
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,630
And I can't make you stay

38
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,230
And I can't make you stay

39
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,980
And I can't make you stay

40
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,630
And I can't make you stay

41
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:54,950
All I wanted was you

42
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,010
And I let it slip away

43
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:05,370
All I wanted was you

44
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,060
-was you

45
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,250
And I can't make you stay
