Scripts were generated using Deepseek AI using the following prompt:

okay so, i wanna do something scripted in terms of subtitles.
i want to basically create a snake in subtitles using positions. basically like I would be plotting some basic points as input and you would create me a script that fills the dots between.

* make it in python
* orient yourself onto the coordinates in the input (allow canvas to be whatever, but for now focus on 2560x1440)
* maybe allow some form of Bezier curve in the aftermath for me to decide
* have an option that allows each point gets shown separately, or that they all appear sequentially without all disappearing (until the last "point")
